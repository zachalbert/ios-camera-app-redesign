            <p>
              The iOS camera app is accessible from the lock screen and integrates 
              with many third party apps, which gives it huge potential to be a 
              powerful creative tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, the app is plagued by some usability issues, and it 
              doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of many of the recent advances in camera 
              hardware such as focus, white balance, and ISO control. I want to 
              address these issues in this redesign.
            </p>
            <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>
              As with all unsolicited redesigns, the problem space I&rsquo;m 
              exploring and user base I&rsquo;m designing for is vastly different 
              &mdash; and much smaller &mdash; than the team that designed the 
              original. This is a thought exercise designed to build on their 
              solution, not tear down what they&rsquo;ve created.
            </p>
          </section>
          
          <section>
            <h2>The Problem Brief</h2>
            
            <p>
              In this redesign, there were 3 main problems that I wanted to address. 
              I arrived at these issues by blending my own findings with those of 
              a handful of active users of the default camera app to ensure I 
              wasn&rsquo;t alone in my assumptions.
            </p>
            <p>
              All in all, the default camera app doesn&rsquo;t seem to fit with 
              the Apple ethos of providing elegant, yet powerful creative tools. 
              It's overly simplified yet also tries to do too many things, such 
              as providing a separate mode just for taking square photos.
            </p>
            <h3>Scoping the problem</h3>
            <p>
              The camera app could be a huge project to tackle, since it currently 
              incorporates everything from taking a simple photo to different 
              modes, editing, sharing, etc. In order to more deeply explore the 
              top three problems I unconvered in user interviews, I&rsquo;ve 
              decided to limit the scope of this redesign just to photo mode, 
              manually adjusting settings, and faster access to video mode. While 
              keeping landscape mode in mind, I didn't create a separate prototype 
              for it. I also gave myself a one week timebox to force tradeoffs 
              and make the project more realistic.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem 1</h3>
            <p>
              The camera app fails to take advantage of much of the power that 
              newer model iPhones provide, such as independent ISO and shutter 
              speed controls, and the ability to manually adjust focus. This 
              functionality could be harnessed to give users greater creative 
              control. While there is a newly introduced manual exposure control 
              in iOS 8, this is a blend between shutter speed and ISO.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem 2</h3>
            <p>
              There is a huge lost opportunity in that the volume controls 
              <strong>only</strong> allow a user to snap a photo. While convenient, 
              they could do so much more. For instance, they could allow for easy 
              adjustment of the aforementioned features like ISO, shutter speed, 
              and focus.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem 3</h3>
            <p>
              Switching camera modes is very difficult, requiring a side swipe in 
              a tiny space that hides 3&ndash;4 of the available options. This 
              results in fumbling around to switch to the appropriate mode before 
              the moment is lost, despite that fact that a mode like 
              &ldquo;video&rdquo; is more likely to be needed quickly, whereas 
              &ldquo;self timer&rdquo; mode nearly always requires ample setup 
              for the shot.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h2>User Research</h2>

            <p>
              I began by picking 8 people, and asked them their favorite part 
              about using the app, and what their top three frustrations were.
            </p>
            <p>
              While it would seem intuitive to only ask iOS users, I did ask a 
              couple who use Android in order to hear what they really liked about 
              the experience. Of the iOS interviewees, most were casual users of 
              the camera app and didn&rsquo;t have strong opinions about it; two 
              were professional designers with a strong aesthetic sense and 
              opinions about photography; and one is a professional photographer 
              who uses iOS devices for a good number of projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              A universal frustration was the difficulty of switching camera modes 
              and potentially losing moments &mdash; though this only applied to 
              the main camera and video modes. Most interviewees were lukewarm 
              on the app, but the 3 heaviest users sought a greater degree of 
              control and power.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another interesting piece of feedback was the desire to use the 
              volume buttons for more than simply snapping a photo. Even though 
              iOS 8 does provide manual exposure control (an automatic combination 
              of shutter speed and ISO), it&rsquo;s accessed first by tapping the 
              screen, then sliding up or down. It&rsquo;s a bit awkward.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              &ldquo;I am grateful for the ability to use either one of the 
              volume buttons to take a picture within the iOS camera app.  It 
              would be great if I could do other things in the camera app with 
              those volume buttons, too.  Like, adjust exposure compensation or 
              as a way to close-focus.  Those sorts of things are tedious to do 
              with touch gestures.&rdquo;<br>
              <span class="quote-author pull-right">&mdash; Zach McCabe</span>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              One interviewee also mentioned the 
              <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nokia+pro+cam&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=gTFTVO6nOc6UyASC0oLgDQ&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAw&biw=1122&bih=574" target="_blank">Nokia ProCam app</a>, 
              which has a pleasing way to manage the various camera controls on 
              a small mobile screen.

            <h2>Critiquing the Current UI</h2>

            <p>
              <img src="images/current-ios-camera-ui.jpg" width="280" height="497" class="pull-right img-margin" alt="Screenshot of current iOS camera UI">
            </p>
            <p>
              The architecture of the current UI is a bit confusing. Features 
              like filters, flash, and self-timer mode get prime real estate while 
              the user has to hunt for video mode. The context for a self timed 
              shot, for instance, nearly always requires a carefully staged shot 
              &mdash; whereas video mode is often required to spontaneously capture 
              moments that could be gone in an instant. The information 
              architecture leads to a hunt-and-peck sort of experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The button to take a photo has a narrow hit area, despite the 
              availability of space to the left and right. While I appreciate the 
              similar visual motif through all the camera modes, I&rsquo;ve 
              missed the button on more than one occasion.
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, since this is a thought exercise, I&rsquo;ve exercised 
              creative license and removed features that I don&rsquo;t think 
              belong, such as filters. Following the concept of an app doing one 
              thing well, I reserve post-processing for other apps such as 
              instagram or VSCO, and let the default camera app be for quick, 
              on-the-fly capture. I&rsquo;ve also relegated controls like flash 
              to a backseat role, since I and several interviewees keep it off 
              in order to encourage reliance on natural lighting.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the most grievous issue with the UI is the camera mode 
              carousel. Panoramic, slo-mo, square and time lapse modes 
              shouldn&rsquo;t be on an equal footing with photo and video. 
              What&rsquo;s more, when you&rsquo;re in time-lapse mode for instance, 
              you&rsquo;re only able to see slo-mo &mdash; leaving the user 
              scratching their head as to where the other four modes are.
            </p>

            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            
            <p>
              Once I understood the problems I was solving for, I started 
              sketching some ideas. I always start with pen and paper, as it 
              allows me to iterate through many ideas rapidly. I quickly moved 
              from sketching to using an app called 
              <a href="https://popapp.in/" target="_blank">POP</a>. This allows 
              me to take photos of drawings, and link screens together to 
              simulate a flow. While rudimentary, it makes it easy to get the 
              &ldquo;feel&rdquo; for how an app might work.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/sketches.jpg" width="1000" height="835" alt="Prototyping sketches">
            </p>
            <p>
              At several points, I asked my user testers to play around with the 
              prototypes I was creating. This real time feedback helped ensure I 
              was on the right track, and that I wasn&rsquo;t missing anything.
            </p>
            <p>
              From POP, I moved into prototyping with 
              <a href="http://proto.io/" target="_blank">Proto.io</a> for a higher 
              fidelity experience. I was very impressed with the power that 
              Proto.io provided, which allowed for complex, chained interactions 
              with fine-grained easing control. While it's just a prototype and 
              doesn't demonstrate <em>everything</em> possible with a native app, 
              it does come pretty close.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first version of the prototype gave me the ability to test the 
              size of my buttons, and to play around with how the interactions 
              work. Like all first versions, it kind of sucked.
            </p>
            <h3>Prototype V1 (go ahead, play around with it)</h3>
            <p>
              <div class="protoio-embed-prototype" data-account="zachalbert" data-project="a7e40343-7a6a-4308-bcc5-98b797a3247e" data-version="1" data-show-sidebuttons="0" style="width: 100%; height: 400px;"></div>
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php" target="_blank"><img src="images/reach-pattern.jpg" width="115" height="160" alt="Mobile reach pattern" class="pull-right img-margin"></a>While 
              this first prototype didn&rsquo;t attempt to model everything, I 
              quickly ran into problems. I received positive feedback on the 
              sliders, but realized that it was difficult to see how the values 
              on the sliders change in real time. Also, the settings and video 
              buttons were too crowded and hard to tap.
            </p>
            <p>
              I reworked the prototype to solve some of these issues. I started 
              by swapping the settings bar to the left. I also attempted to deal 
              more realistically with how a user might change settings like 
              manual focus, flash, and HDR, and also how to hint that tapping 
              one of the adjustments transfers control to the volume buttons on 
              the phone hardware.
            </p>
            <h3>Prototype V2</h3>
            <div class="protoio-embed-prototype" data-account="zachalbert" data-project="4dfa37d0-4adb-4906-98b9-64ffdbd116aa" data-version="2" data-show-sidebuttons="0" style="width: 100%; height: 400px;"></div>

            </p>
            <h3>UI Animation</h3>
            <p>
              Finally, I chose to do a quick animation of a couple interactions 
              at the highest fidelity in After Effects to really show how the 
              sliders interact with each other and change the image. An animation 
              also helps to demonstrate how the movements feel. You can see the 
              animation at the top of this page.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>
              Overall I've received very positive feedback from my user testers, 
              as this has solved many of the problems they have with the default 
              camera app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since I timeboxed this project to a single week, there&rsquo;s a 
              <em>lot</em> more that I didn't have time to tackle. In many ways 
              this is just a first step, but going through this exercise taught 
              me a lot. If I had allowed myself more time, I'd probably want to:
              <ul>
                <li>Work through the various camera modes such as pano, 
                time-lapse, and slo-mo.</li>
                <li>Broaden the scope to the entire flow of snapping a photo, 
                editing, and posting to social media.</li>
                <li>Figure out how to add an easy QR code reader.</li>
                <li>Testing with more users, and continue to iron the kinks out.</li>
              </ul>
              Thanks for reading!
